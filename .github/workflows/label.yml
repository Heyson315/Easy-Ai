# This workflow will triage pull requests and apply a label based on the
# paths that are modified in the pull request.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to set up a .github/labeler.yml
# file with configuration.  For more information, see:
# https://github.com/actions/labeler

name: Labeler
# Note: pull_request_target is used (not pull_request) because:
# 1. It provides write access to pull-requests needed for labeling
# 2. It uses the labeler.yml from the base branch (not the PR branch)
# 3. This prevents malicious PRs from modifying label rules
# SECURITY: Never checkout PR code in this workflow, as that would introduce a vulnerability.
